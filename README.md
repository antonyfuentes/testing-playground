# Testing Playground
This is a real-world app built with wordpress. This is pre-populated with specific plugins, settings and data. This is a good option for anyone who wants to develop its software testing skills.

## Setup on Mac and Linux:
- Install docker
- Download (or clone) this repository
- Using your terminal cd into the root folder of the project
- Run this script to run the app on docker: `sudo bash start-app-mac-linux.sh`
- Wait for the script to finish running
- Navigate to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)

## Setup on Windows:
- Install docker toolbox
- Download (or clone) this repository
- Using the Docker QuickStart Terminal, cd into the root folder of the project
- Docker toolbox uses a VirtualBox VM to run its containers, to make sure that the VM has enough space run this script to re-create the VM: `bash windows/re-create-docker-machine.sh`
- Then run this script to run the app on docker toolbox: `bash start-app-windows.sh`
- Wait for the script to finish running
- Navigate to the URL printed in the terminal

## API Details:

- Wordpress RestAPI:
  - This API provides different endpoints to execute actions against Wordpress
  - Endpoint: http://localhost:8000/wp-json/wp/v2/
  - Documentation: https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference/

  - Endpoint: http://localhost:8000/graphql
  - Playground: http://localhost:8000/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-graphiql%2Fwp-graphiql.php

## Notes:
- While running the commands above, sometimes docker could get stuck while downloading some image layers. If that is your case, cancel the command with `CTRL + C` and rerun the script again
- Since this is a dummy site, I'm publicly sharing the following:
  - User/Password: `automation/automation`
  - Consumer key:  `ck_747561c1957b4d5e9c4ba174397365f9bdf43ab7`
  - Consumer secret:  `cs_ae256b8de43dd771568cab572c8c135b11ff21f3`
  
## This is how the application looks:
